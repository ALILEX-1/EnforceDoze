        <change>New: Android Nougat support. Please grant WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS permission via ADB if you are not rooted.</change>

        <change>New: App Shortcuts support on Nougat 7.1+. You can press and hold the ForceDoze icon on your homescreen to access shortcuts to Settings and Battery stats.</change>
        <change>New: Doze Tunables support so you can modify Doze parameters directly. (requires root to apply changes directly)</change>

        <change>New: Chinese (Traditional) translations - Thanks to osk2 on GitHub!</change>

        <change>Changed: SU detection method. It should work more reliably now</change>
        <change>Changed: App Shortcuts icon design (Thanks kryzeK on XDA!)</change>

        <change>Fixed: ForceDoze not adding itself to Doze whitelist on Nougat. Now, it will show you a notification that will take you to the battery optimisation settings to manually add ForceDoze, as it's not possible to add it automatically by ForceDoze on Nougat.</change>
        <change>Fixed: ForceDoze calling deviceidle to add itself to whitelist, causing an exception because DEVICE_POWER permission wasn't granted. The permission cannot be granted to apps like ForceDoze, hence a workaround has been implemented as described above.</change>

        <change>Fixed: Doze stats scrolling down automatically when you open it.</change>
