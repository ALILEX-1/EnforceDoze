        <change>New: Option to disable motion sensing for Doze, without disabling device motion sensors. This feature is EXPERIMENTAL and requires Xposed. Please
        let me know if this option works as intended or not. To activate, turn on the Xposed module and the option in Settings.</change>
        <change>Changed: ForceDoze now ignores lockscreen timeout value by default, so a wake lock is no longer required. If this has unwanted effects, please
        disable 'Ignore lockscreen timeout' in Settings. PS: You might have to manually turn it on if you're updating the app and this isn't the first install</change>
